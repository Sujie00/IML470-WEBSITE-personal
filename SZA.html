    <h4>SZA</h4>
    <p class="bio">Solána Imani Rowe, known professionally as SZA, is an American singer-songwriter. 
      She first gained recognition through her self-released extended plays, See.SZA.Run and S,
       which helped her become the first female artist to sign with Top Dawg Entertainment. Her third EP, Z, 
       was her first project to be released to digital retailers and reached the top-ten on the US Independent Albums chart.
      After signing a joint recording contract with RCA Records, SZA released her debut studio album, Ctrl.
       It was met with critical and commercial success, earning four Grammy Award nominations and becoming the second
        longest-charting R&B album by a female artist on the Billboard 200. The following year, SZA was nominated for
         the Golden Globe and Academy Awards for Best Original Song via her collaboration with Kendrick Lamar on the
          US and UK top-ten single "All the Stars". </p>
